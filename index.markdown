Hi! I’m Stephan, a second-year PhD student in the [Machine Learning Department](https://ml.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University advised by [Ameet Talwalkar](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~atalwalk/), and supported by the NSF GRFP. I'm broadly interested in topics within machine learning and decision-making.

Previously, I did my undergrad at the University of Pennsylvania [School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/) studying Computer Science and Mathematical Economics.  At Penn I was fortunate to work with  [Aaron Roth](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/) on calibration and learning theory, [Kevin He](https://www.kevinhe.net) on social learning, as well as Yi Xing and Robert Wang at the [Xing Lab](https://xinglab.org/) on computational biology.

In my free time in undergrad I danced, choreographed, and filmed for [Pan-Asian Dance Troupe](https://www.youtube.com/@PanAsianDanceTroupe/videos), and I am a long-time wushu student and enthusiast. I also compose and play instrumental [music](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL7ewZWw3-y07CWUQkstSa4rG5a3kQgFT) (formerly with Penn Chamber), primarily for the piano.

Hi! Iâ€™m Stephan, a first-year PhD student in the ML department at Carnegie Mellon University supported by the NSF GRFP. Previously, I did my undergrad at the University of Pennsylvania [School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/) studying Computer Science and Mathematical Economics. I'm broadly interested in topics within machine learning and decision-making. At Penn I was fortunate to work with [Kevin He](https://www.kevinhe.net) and [Aaron Roth](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/) on social learning, algorithmic fairness, and learning theory, as well as Yi Xing and Robert Wang at the [Xing Lab](https://xinglab.org/) on computational biology.

In my free time in undergrad I danced, choreographed, and filmed for [Pan-Asian Dance Troupe](https://www.youtube.com/@PanAsianDanceTroupe/videos), and I am a long-time wushu student and enthusiast. I also [compose](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Aft9ovrLo3vAb2Gn_iI3C46F12tuQqtRGGP0ZZS4SHM/edit?usp=sharing) and play instrumental music (formerly with Penn Chamber), primarily for the piano.

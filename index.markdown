Hi! Iâ€™m Stephan, a third-year BSE student in the University of Pennsylvania [School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/) studying Computer Science and Mathematical Economics. I'm interested in topics within machine learning, game theory, and economics. I am fortunate to work with [Kevin He](kevinhe.net) and [Aaron Roth](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/) on social learning, algorithmic fairness, and learning theory.

In my free time I dance, choreograph, and film for [Pan-Asian Dance Troupe](https://www.youtube.com/@PanAsianDanceTroupe/videos), and I am a long-time wushu student and enthusiast. I also compose and play instrumental music (formerly with Penn Chamber), primarily for the piano.
